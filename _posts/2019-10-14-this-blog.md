# This blog

Yo.

As well as the usual diet of books and papers, I have learned quite a lot of useful things about quantum computing from internet resources. Examples include Craig Gidney’s blog[^1] and the infamous Rod Van Meter tweetstorm[^2]. I want to also add some small bits of knowledge that I find interesting, mostly about QC or QC-adjacent topics. Some of these things will be (in some sense) novel, but not noteworthy enough to put in a paper.

About me: I am a software developer working for Cambridge Quantum Computing[^3]. We currently deal with what Rod refers to as “NISQy business”. My main work is on the compilation of algorithms to devices, and I use tools such as the ZX-calculus[^4] to reason about quantum circuits. We have put out some papers on this topic.
The papers I have worked on can be found on arXiv [^5]. Luckily there aren't many "Cowtan"s out there so I'm easy to find.
